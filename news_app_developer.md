## News Applications Developer

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is looking for a News Applications Developer to join the newsroom's Data and News Applications team.

The right candidate will have skills as both a journalist and programmer and will be able to design and build creative, meaningful products for the AJC's digital platforms. Candidates should have experience in successfully conceptualizing and building news apps, data visualizations and interactive graphics. Additionally, she or he will help support existing AJC news applications. 

As part of the Data and News Applications team, you will join a group of data specialists, developers and designers working to make the AJC's most important stories come alive in compelling and innovative ways. You'll have room to experiment, freedom to learn new skills as the industry progresses and opportunities to work on the projects that interest you most. You'll also serve as an advocate of data and visual journalism in the newsroom, encouraging newsroom journalists to experiment with new tools for digital storytelling.

Here's some examples of the work we do:
- We work with the investigations team on some of their most important work, giving their stories highly visual and engaging presences online. Recently, we built a microsite and content/templating engine for the AJC's national investigative series, [Doctors & Sex Abuse](http://doctors.ajc.com/). Last year, we built [Over the Line](http://investigations.myajc.com/overtheline/), which included a [searchable database](http://investigations.myajc.com/overtheline/database/) and [interactive graphics](http://investigations.myajc.com/overtheline/by-the-numbers/), for the AJC's year-long investigation of police shootings in Georgia.
- We build and maintain news applications such as [Crime in ATL](http://crime.myajc.com/), the [Georgia Legistlative Navigator](http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/), [Hospital Checkup](http://hospitals.myajc.com/) and [The Ultimate Atlanta School Guide](http://schools.myajc.com/).
- We design and develop interactive graphics like these:
	- [How does your income stack up?](http://specialprojects.myajc.com/graphics/middle-class/)
	- [Tracking Katrina evacuees after the storm](http://specialprojects.myajc.com/graphics/katrina/)
	- [A half-century of mass shootings in the U.S.](http://specialprojects.myajc.com/graphics/mass-shootings/)
- We write quick-turn blog-style posts on breaking or timely news:
	- [Super Bowl ticket price tracker](http://www.ajc.com/sports/football/super-bowl-tickets-for/RnCznjWq5EHQkmW1DUkqFM/)
	- [Where Matt Ryan threw each of his 534 passes for the Atlanta Falcons](http://www.myajc.com/sports/football/where-matt-ryan-threw-each-his-534-passes-for-the-atlanta-falcons/rKleVeMoElmfVmTAXX7RzM/)
- And sometimes we build immersive, visual storytelling experiences like these:
	- [War in our backyards](http://battleofatlanta.myajc.com/)
	- [Forgotten memories](http://memories.myajc.com/)


We're looking for applicants with 1-5 years of newsroom experience, but applicants with strong technical skills will also be considered.

Skills:

- Demonstrated design skills and experience in visualizing data
- Strong HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills required
- Experience with D3.js and with an MVC framework such as Backbone a plus
- Experience with a server-side scripting language such as Ruby, Python or Node.js, and with web development frameworks such as Rails or Django
- Strong sense of urgency, high energy and tenacity to create content for the AJC's digital platforms
- Work samples are required
